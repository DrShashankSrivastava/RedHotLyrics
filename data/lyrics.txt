Sailing the Sunset Strip, I'm a bit of a king
Granny would take a trip, I've been bending the strings
Got hammers in both my hands, such a delicate touch
They say I'm from Amsterdam, does that make me Dutch?
Please don't remember me for what I did last night, oh
Please don't remember me
Lord and children
Please don't remember me, it's only 1980
It's only 1983
Smoking the reefer, feeling my own light
My brother's a keeper, I married a TV wife
The devil's Camaro, parked in the high school lot
A little sombrero 'cause teacher was way too hot
Please don't remember me for what I did last night, oh
Please don't remember me
Listen Lord now
Please don't remember me, it's only 1980
It's only 1983
Tell my love "But leave me never"
Can't complain about the weather
Snowing at the rainbow, have a ball
Cut my teeth down at the Whiskey
GTO's tried to kiss me
One more song, they have seen it all
Please don't remember me for what I did last night, oh
Please don't remember me
What'd I say Lord?
Please don't remember me, it's only 1980
It's only 1983
Please don't remember me for what I did with David
You know I'm talkin' David Lee
Am I ready?
Please don't remember me, for what I did last night, oh

Down the street, you can hear her scream, "You're a disgrace!"
As she slams the door in his drunken face
And now, he stands outside
All the neighbors start to gossip and drool
He cries, "Oh girl, you must be mad
What happened to the sweet love you and me had?"
Against the door, he leans, and starts a scene
But his tears fall, burn, and gard-all green

And some castle made of sand
Fall in the sea eventually

An Indian brave, who before he was ten
Played war games in the woods with his Indian friends
And he built a dream, that when he grew up
He would be a fearless warrior, Indian Chief
Many moons passed, and more, the dream grew strong
Until tomorrow, he would sing his first war song
Fight his first battle
But somethin' went wrong
Surprise attack killed him in his sleep that night

And some castle made of sand
Melts into the sea eventually
Take it, Johnny

There was a young girl who was heart with a frown
She was crippled for life, and she couldn't speak a sound
And she wished and prayed she could stop livin'
So she decided to die
She drew her wheelchair to the edge of the shore
And to her legs she smiled, "You won't hurt me no more."
But then, a sight she'd never seen made her jump and say
"Look a golden-winged ship is passin' my way."
But it really didn't have to stop
It just kept on goin'

And some castles made of sand
Slips into the sea, eventually

There must be something in the way I feel
That she don't want me to feel
The stare she bares cut me
I don't care, you see, so what if I bleed?
I could never change just what I feel
My face will never show what is not real

A mountain never seemed to have the need to speak
A look that shares so many seek
The sweetest feeling I got from you
The things I said to you were true
I could never change just what I feel
My face will never show what is not real

I could have lied, I'm such a fool
My eyes could never, never, never keep their cool
Showed her and I told her how
She struck me but I'm fucked up now

But now she gone, yeah, she gone away
A soulful song that would not stay
You see, she hides 'cause she is scared
But I don't care, I won't be spared

I could have lied, I'm such a fool
My eyes could never, never, never keep their cool
Showed her and I told her how
She struck me but I'm fucked up now

I could have lied, I'm such a fool
My eyes could never, never, never keep their cool
I showed her and I told her how
She struck me but I'm fucked up now

Fucked up
